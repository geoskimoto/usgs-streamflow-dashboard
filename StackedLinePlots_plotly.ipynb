    "# This notebook demonstrates the new streamflow analysis tool that provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Easy USGS data fetching** using the official `dataretrieval` library\n",
    "# - **Water year analysis** (Oct 1 - Sep 30) with proper day-of-water-year plotting\n",
    "# - **Comprehensive statistics** (percentiles, means, medians, etc.)\n",
    "# - **Interactive Plotly visualizations** with multiple water years overlaid\n",
    "# - **Publication-quality plots** with customizable styling\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Features:\n",
    "# - Fetch data from any USGS streamflow gauge\n",
    "# - Calculate water year statistics\n",
    "# - Create stacked line plots for year-over-year comparison\n",
    "# - Highlight specific years of interest\n",
    "# - Add percentile bands and statistical overlays\n",

    "1. **`date_column` parameter error**: Updated `StreamflowData.__init__()` to accept `date_column` and `value_column` parameters\n",
